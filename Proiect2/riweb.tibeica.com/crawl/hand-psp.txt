Mod_python Manual Previous: 6.1.3 Form Data Up: 6. Standard Handlers Next: 6.3 CGI Handler     6.2 PSP Handler PSP handler is a handler that processes documents using the PSP class in mod_python.psp module. To use it, simply add this to your httpd configuration: 
  AddHandler mod_python .psp
  PythonHandler mod_python.psp
 For more details on the PSP syntax, see Section 4.9. If PythonDebug server configuration is On, then by appending an underscore ("_") to the end of the url you can get a nice side-by-side listing of original PSP code and resulting Python code generated by the psp module. This is very useful for debugging. Note: Leaving debug on in a production environment will allow remote users to display source code of your PSP pages!
