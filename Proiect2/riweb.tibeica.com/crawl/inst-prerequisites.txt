Mod_python Manual Previous: 2. Installation Up: 2. Installation Next: 2.2 Compiling   2.1 Prerequisites Python 2.2.1 or later. Earlier versions of Python will not work. Apache 2.0.40 or later (For Apache 1.3.x, use mod_python version 2.7.x). In order to compile mod_python you will need to have the include files for both Apache and Python, as well as the Python library installed on your system. If you installed Python and Apache from source, then you already have everything needed. However, if you are using prepackaged software (e.g. Red Hat Linux RPM, Debian, or Solaris packages from sunsite, etc) then chances are, you have just the binaries and not the sources on your system. Often, the Apache and Python include files and libraries necessary to compile mod_python are part of separate ``development'' package. If you are not sure whether you have all the necessary files, either compile and install Python and Apache from source, or refer to the documentation for your system on how to get the development packages.
