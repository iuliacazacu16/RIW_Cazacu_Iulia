Mod_python Manual Previous: 6.1.2.3 Authentication Up: 6.1 Publisher Handler Next: 6.2 PSP Handler 6.1.3 Form Data In the process of matching arguments, the Publisher handler creates an instance of FieldStorage class. A reference to this instance is stored in an attribute form of the Request object. Since a FieldStorage can only be instantiated once per request, one must not attempt to instantiate FieldStorage when using the Publisher handler and should use Request.form instead.
