Mod_python Manual Previous: 5.4.1 PythonEnablePdb Up: 5.4 Other Directives Next: 5.4.3 PythonImport     5.4.2 PythonDebug Syntax: PythonDebug {On, Off} Default: PythonDebug Off Context: server config, virtual host, directory, htaccess Override: not None Module: mod_python.c Normally, the traceback output resulting from uncaught Python errors is sent to the error log. With PythonDebug On directive specified, the output will be sent to the client (as well as the log), except when the error is IOError while writing, in which case it will go to the error log. This directive is very useful during the development process. It is recommended that you do not use it production environment as it may reveal to the client unintended, possibly sensitive security information.
