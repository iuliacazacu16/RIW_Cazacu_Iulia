Mod_python Manual Previous: 1.1 Performance Up: 1. Introduction Next: 1.3 History   1.2 Flexibility Apache processes requests in phases (e.g. read the request, parse headers, check access, etc.). These phases can be implemented by functions called handlers. Traditionally, handlers are written in C and compiled into Apache modules. Mod_python provides a way to extend Apache functionality by writing Apache handlers in Python. For a detailed description of the Apache request processing process, see the Apache API Notes, as well as the Mod_python - Integrating Python with Apache paper. To ease migration from CGI, a standard mod_python handler is provided that simulates the CGI environment allowing a user to run legacy scripts under mod_python with no changes to the code (in most cases).
