Mod_python Manual Previous: 6.1 Publisher Handler Up: 6.1 Publisher Handler Next: 6.1.2 The Publishing Algorithm   6.1.1 Introduction To use the handler, you need the following lines in your configuration 
  <Directory /some/path>
    SetHandler mod_python 
    PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
    </Directory>
 This handler allows access to functions and variables within a module via URL's. For example, if you have the following module, called hello.py: 
  """ Publisher example """

  def say(req, what="NOTHING"):
  return "I am saying %s" % what
 A URL http://www.mysite.com/hello.py/say would return "I am saying NOTHING". A URL http://www.mysite.com/hello.py/say?what=hello would return "I am saying hello".
