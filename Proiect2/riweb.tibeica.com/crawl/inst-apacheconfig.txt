Mod_python Manual Previous: 2.3.1 Running make install Up: 2.3 Installing Next: 2.4 Testing   2.3.2 Configuring Apache If you compiled mod_python as a DSO, you will need to tell Apache to load the module by adding the following line in the Apache configuration file, usually called httpd.conf or apache.conf: 
    LoadModule python_module libexec/mod_python.so
   The actual path to mod_python.so may vary, but make install should report at the very end exactly where mod_python.so was placed and how the LoadModule directive should appear.
