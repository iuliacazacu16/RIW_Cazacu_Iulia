Mod_python Manual Previous: 5.1.4 PythonHeaderParserHandler Up: 5.1 Request Handlers Next: 5.1.6 PythonAccessHandler     5.1.5 PythonInitHandler Syntax: Python*Handler Syntax Context: server config, virtual host, directory, htaccess Override: not None Module: mod_python.c This handler is the first handler called in the request processing phases that is allowed both inside and outside .htaccess and directory. This handler is actually an alias to two different handlers. When specified in the main config file outside any directory tags, it is an alias to PostReadRequestHandler. When specified inside directory (where PostReadRequestHandler is not allowed), it aliases to PythonHeaderParserHandler. (This idea was borrowed from mod_perl) Mod_python Manual Previous: 5.1.4 PythonHeaderParserHandler Up: 5.1 Request Handlers Next: 5.1.6 PythonAccessHandler Release 3.2.8, documentation updated on February 19, 2006.
