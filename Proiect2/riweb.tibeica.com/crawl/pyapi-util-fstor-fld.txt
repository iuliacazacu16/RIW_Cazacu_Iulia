Mod_python Manual Previous: 4.6.1 FieldStorage class Up: 4.6 util - Miscellaneous Next: 4.6.3 Other functions   4.6.2 Field class class Field( ) This class is used internally by FieldStorage and is not meant to be instantiated by the user. Each instance of a Field class represents an HTML Form input. Field instances have the following attributes: name The input name. value The input value. This attribute can be used to read data from a file upload as well, but one has to exercise caution when dealing with large files since when accessed via value, the whole file is read into memory. file This is a file-like object. For file uploads it points to a TemporaryFile instance. (For more information see the TemporaryFile class in the standard python tempfile module). For simple values, it is a StringIO object, so you can read simple string values via this attribute instead of using the value attribute as well. filename The name of the file as provided by the client. type The content-type for this input as provided by the client. type_options This is what follows the actual content type in the content-type header provided by the client, if anything. This is a dictionary. disposition The value of the first part of the content-disposition header. disposition_options The second part (if any) of the content-disposition header in the form of a dictionary. See Also: RFC 1867, Form-based File Upload in HTML for a description of form-based file uploads Mod_python Manual Previous: 4.6.1 FieldStorage class Up: 4.6 util - Miscellaneous Next: 4.6.3 Other functions Release 3.2.8, documentation updated on February 19, 2006.
