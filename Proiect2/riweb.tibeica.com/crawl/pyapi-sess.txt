Python API Next: 4.8.1 Classes   4.8 Session - Session Management The Session module provides objects for maintaining persistent sessions across requests. The module contains a BaseSession class, which is not meant to be used directly (it provides no means of storing a session), DbmSession class, which uses a dbm to store sessions, and FileSession class, which uses individual files to store sessions. The BaseSession class also provides session locking, both across processes and threads. For locking it uses APR global_mutexes (a number of them is pre-created at startup) The mutex number is computed by using modulus of the session id hash(). (Therefore it's possible that different session id's will have the same hash, but the only implication is that those two sessions cannot be locked at the same time resulting in a slight delay.)
