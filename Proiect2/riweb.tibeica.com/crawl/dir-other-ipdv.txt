Mod_python Manual Previous: 5.4.4 PythonInterpPerDirectory Up: 5.4 Other Directives Next: 5.4.6 PythonInterpreter     5.4.5 PythonInterpPerDirective Syntax: PythonInterpPerDirective {On, Off} Default: PythonInterpPerDirective Off Context: server config, virtual host, directory, htaccess Override: not None Module: mod_python.c Instructs mod_python to name subinterpreters using the directory in which the Python*Handler directive currently in effect was encountered. For example, assume there is a /directory/subdirectory. /directory has an .htaccess file with a PythonHandler directive. /directory/subdirectory has another .htaccess file with another PythonHandler. By default, scripts in /directory and /directory/subdirectory would execute in the same interpreter assuming both directories are in the same virtual server. With PythonInterpPerDirective, there would be two different interpreters, one for each directive.
