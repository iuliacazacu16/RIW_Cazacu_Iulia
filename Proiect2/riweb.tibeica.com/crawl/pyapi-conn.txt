Mod_python Manual Previous: 4.3 Overview of a Up: 4. Python API Next: 4.5 apache - Access   4.4 Overview of a Connection Handler   A connection handler handles the connection, starting almost immediately from the point the TCP connection to the server was made. Unlike HTTP handlers, connection handlers receive a connection object as an argument. Connection handlers can be used to implement protocols. Here is an example of a simple echo server: Apache configuration: 
  PythonConnectionHandler echo
 Contents of echo.py file: 
from mod_python import apache

def connectionhandler(conn):

    while 1:
        conn.write(conn.readline())

    return apache.OK
