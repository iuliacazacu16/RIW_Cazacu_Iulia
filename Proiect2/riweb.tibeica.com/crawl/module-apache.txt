Mod_python Manual Previous: 4.4 Overview of a Up: 4. Python API Next: 4.5.1 Functions 4.5 apache - Access to Apache Internals. The Python interface to Apache internals is contained in a module appropriately named apache, located inside the mod_python package. This module provides some important objects that map to Apache internal structures, as well as some useful functions, all documented below. (The request object also provides an interface to Apache internals, it is covered in its own section of this manual.)   The apache module can only be imported by a script running under mod_python. This is because it depends on a built-in module _apache provided by mod_python. It is best imported like this: 
from mod_python import apache
 mod_python.apache module defines the following functions and objects. For a more in-depth look at Apache internals, see the Apache Developer page Subsections 4.5.1 Functions 4.5.2 Table Object (mp_table)  4.5.3 Request Object  4.5.3.1 Request Methods 4.5.3.2 Request Members 4.5.4 Connection Object (mp_conn)  4.5.4.1 Connection Methods 4.5.4.2 Connection Members 4.5.5 Filter Object (mp_filter)  4.5.5.1 Filter Methods 4.5.5.2 Filter Members 4.5.6 Server Object (mp_server)  4.5.6.1 Server Methods 4.5.6.2 Server Members Mod_python Manual Previous: 4.4 Overview of a Up: 4.
