Unlike all the other handlers, the return value of this handler is ignored. Any errors will be logged to the error log, but will not be sent to the client, even if PythonDebug is On. This handler is not a valid argument to the rec.add_handler() function. For dynamic clean up registration, use req.register_cleanup(). Once cleanups have started, it is not possible to register more of them. Therefore, req.register_cleanup() has no effect within this handler. Cleanups registered with this directive will execute after cleanups registered with req.register_cleanup().
