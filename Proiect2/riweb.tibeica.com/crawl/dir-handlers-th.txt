Mod_python Manual Previous: 5.1.2 PythonPostReadRequestHandler Up: 5.1 Request Handlers Next: 5.1.4 PythonHeaderParserHandler     5.1.3 PythonTransHandler Syntax: Python*Handler Syntax Context: server config, virtual host Override: not None Module: mod_python.c This handler gives allows for an opportunity to translate the URI into an actual filename, before the server's default rules (Alias directives and the like) are followed. Note: At the time when this phase of the request is being processed, the URI has not been translated into a path name, therefore this directive will never be executed by Apache if specified within <Directory>, <Location>, <File> directives or in an .htaccess file. The only place this can be specified is the main configuration file, and the code for it will execute in the main interpreter.
