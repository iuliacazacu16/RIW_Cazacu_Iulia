Mod_python Manual Previous: 4.5.1 Functions Up: 4.5 apache - Access Next: 4.5.3 Request Object    4.5.2 Table Object (mp_table)    class table( [mapping-or-sequence]) Returns a new empty object of type mp_table. See Section 4.5.2 for description of the table object. The mapping-or-sequence will be used to provide initial values for the table. The table object is a wrapper around the Apache APR table. The table object behaves very much like a dictionary (including the Python 2.2 features such as support of the in operator, etc.), with the following differences: Both keys and values must be strings. Key lookups are case-insensitive. Duplicate keys are allowed (see add() below). When there is more than one value for a key, a subscript operation returns a list. Much of the information that Apache uses is stored in tables. For example, req.headers_in and req.headers_out. All the tables that mod_python provides inside the request object are actual mappings to the Apache structures, so changing the Python table also changes the underlying Apache table. In addition to normal dictionary-like behavior, the table object also has the following method: add( key, val) add() allows for creating duplicate keys, which is useful when multiple headers, such as Set-Cookie: are required.
