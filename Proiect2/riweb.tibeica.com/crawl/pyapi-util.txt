Python API Next: 4.6.1 FieldStorage class   4.6 util - Miscellaneous Utilities The util module provides a number of utilities handy to a web application developer similar to those in the standard library cgi module. The implementations in the util module are much more efficient because they call directly into Apache API's as opposed to using CGI which relies on the environment to pass information. The recommended way of using this module is: 
from mod_python import util
